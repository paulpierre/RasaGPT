# 🏠 Overview

💬 RasaGPT is the first headless LLM chatbot platform built on top of Rasa and Langchain. It is boilerplate and a reference implementation of Rasa and Telegram utilizing an LLM library like langchain for indexing, retrieval and context injection.

<br/><br/>

# 💁‍♀️ Why RasaGPT?

RasaGPT just works out of the box. I went through all the implementation headaches so you don’t have to, including

- Creating your own proprietary bot endpoint using FastAPI, document upload and “training” 'pipeline included
- How to integrate Langchain/LlamaIndex and Rasa
- Library conflicts with LLM libraries and passing metadata
- Dockerized support on MacOS for running Rasa
- Reverse proxy with chatbots via ngrok
- Implementing pgvector with your own custom schema instead of using Langchain’s highly opinionated PGVector class
- Adding multi-tenancy, sessions and metadata between Rasa and your own backend / application

The backstory is familiar. A friend came to me with a problem. I scoured Google and Github for a decent reference implementation of LLM’s integrated with Rasa but came up empty-handed. I figured this to be a great opportunity to satiate my curiosity and 2 days later I had a proof of concept, and a week later this is what I came up with.

<br/>

> ⚠️ **Caveat emptor:** 
This is far from production code and rife with prompt injection and general security vulnerabilities. I just hope someone finds this useful 😊

# **✨** Quick start

Getting started is easy, just make sure you meet the dependencies below.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/paulpierre/RasaGPT.git
cd RasaGPT
cp .env-example .env

# Edit your .env file and add all the necessary credentials
make install

# Type "make" to see more options
make
```

<br/><br/>


# 🔥 Features

## Full Application and API

- LLM  “learns” on an arbitrary corpus of data using Langchain
- Upload documents and “train” all via FastAPI
- Document versioning and automatic “re-training” implemented on upload
- Customize your own async endpoints
- Bot determines whether human handoff is necessary
- Bot generates tags based on user questions and response automatically
- Full API documentation via Swagger and Redoc included
- ngrok endpoints are automatically generated for you on startup so your bot can always be accessed via `https://t.me/yourbotname`
- Embedding similarity search built into Postgres via pgvector and Postgres functions
- Dummy data included for you to test and experiment
- Unlimited use cases from help desk, customer support, quiz, e-learning, dungeon and dragons,  and more
<br/><br/>
## Rasa integration

- Built on top of Rasa, the open source gold-standard for chat platforms
- Supports MacOS M1/M2 via Docker (canonical Rasa image lacks MacOS arch. support)
- Supports Telegram, easily integrate Slack, Whatsapp, Line, SMS, etc.
- Setup complex dialog pipelines using NLU models form Huggingface like BERT or libraries/frameworks like Keras, Tensorflow with OpenAI GPT as fallback
<br/><br/>
## Flexibility

- Extend agentic, memory, etc. capabilities with Langchain
- Schema supports multi-tenancy, sessions, data storage
- Customize agent personalities
- Saves all of chat history and creating embeddings from all interactions future-proofing your retrieval strategy
- Automatically generate embeddings from knowledge base corpus and client feedback

# 🧑‍💻 Installing

## Requirements

- Python 3.9
- Docker & Docker compose ([Docker desktop MacOS](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/))
- Open AI [API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
- Telegram [bot credentials](https://core.telegram.org/bots#how-do-i-create-a-bot)
- ngrok [authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/tunnels/authtokens)
- Make ([MacOS](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/make)/[Windows](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32127524/how-to-install-and-use-make-in-windows))
- SQLModel

<br/>

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/paulpierre/RasaGPT.git
cd RasaGPT
cp .env-example .env

# Edit your .env file and all the credentials

```

<br/>


At any point feel free to just type in `make` and it will display the list of options, mostly useful for debugging:

<br/>


![Makefile main](https://github.com/paulpierre/RasaGPT/blob/main/github/makefile-1.png?raw=true)

<br/>

## Docker-compose

```bash
make install

# This will automatically install and run RasaGPT
# After installation, to run again you can simply run

make run
```
<br/>

## Local Python Environment

This is useful if you wish to focus on developing on top of the API, a separate `Makefile` was made for this. This will create a local virtual environment for you.

```bash
# Assuming you are already in the RasaGPT directory
cd app/api
make install

# This will automatically install and run RasaGPT
# After installation, to run again you can simply run

make run
```
<br/>

Similarly, enter `make` to see a full list of commands

![Makefile API](https://github.com/paulpierre/RasaGPT/blob/main/github/makefile-2.png?raw=true)

<br/>

## Installation process

Installation should be automated should look like this:

![Installation](https://github.com/paulpierre/RasaGPT/blob/main/github/cli_install.png?raw=true)

👉 Full installation log: [https://app.warp.dev/block/vflua6Eue29EPk8EVvW8Kd](https://app.warp.dev/block/vflua6Eue29EPk8EVvW8Kd)

<br/>

The installation process for Docker takes the following steps at a high level

1. Check to make sure you have `.env` available
2. Database is initialized with `pgvector`
3. Database models create the database schema
4. Trains the Rasa model so it is ready to run
5. Sets up ngrok with Rasa so Telegram has a webhook back to your API server
6. Sets up the Rasa actions server so Rasa can talk to the RasaGPT API
7. Database is populated with dummy data via `seed.py`

<br/><br/>

# ✏️ Examples

The bot is just a proof-of-concept and has not been optimized for retrieval. It currently uses 1000 character length chunking for indexing and basic euclidean distance for retrieval and quality is hit or miss. 

You can view example hits and misses with the bot in the [RESULTS.MD](https://github.com/paulpierre/RasaGPT/blob/main/RESULTS.md) file. Overall I estimate index optimization and LLM configuration changes can increase output quality by more than 70%.

The recommended dosage is one tablet per day, taken orally with a glass of water, preferably while browsing your favorite meme forum for maximum cognitive enhancement. For optimal results, take Pepetamine 30 minutes before engaging in mentally demanding tasks, such as decoding ancient Pepe hieroglyphics or creating your next viral meme masterpiece.\n\n**Side Effects**\n\nSome potential side effects of Pepetamine may include:\n\n1. Uncontrollable laughter and a sudden appreciation for dank memes\n2. An inexplicable desire to collect rare Pepes\n3. Enhanced meme creation skills, potentially leading to internet fame\n4. Temporary green skin pigmentation, resembling the legendary Pepe himself\n5. Spontaneously speaking in \"feels good man\" language\n\nWhile most side effects are generally harmless, consult your memologist if side effects persist or become bothersome.\n\n**Precautions**\n\nBefore taking Pepetamine, please consider the following precautions:\n\n1. Do not use Pepetamine if you have a known allergy to rare Pepes or dank memes.\n2. Pepetamine may not be suitable for individuals with a history of humor deficiency or meme intolerance.\n3. Exercise caution when driving or operating heavy machinery, as Pepetamine may cause sudden fits of laughter or intense meme ideation.\n\n**Interactions**\n\nPepetamine may interact with other substances, including:\n\n1. Normie supplements: Combining Pepetamine with normie supplements may result in meme conflicts and a decreased sense of humor.\n2. Caffeine: The combination of Pepetamine and caffeine may cause an overload of energy, resulting in hyperactive meme creation and potential internet overload.\n\nConsult your memologist if you are taking any other medications or substances to ensure compatibility with Pepetamine.\n\n**Overdose**\n\nIn case of an overdose, symptoms may include:\n\n1. Uncontrollable meme creation\n2. Delusions of grandeur as the ultimate meme lord\n3. Time warps into the world of Pepe\n\nIf you suspect an overdose, contact your local meme emergency service or visit the nearest meme treatment facility. Remember, the key to enjoying Pepetamine is to use it responsibly, and always keep in mind the wise words of our legendary Pepe: \"Feels good man.\"",

## Node

Although this is not exposed in the API, a node is a chunk of a document which embeddings get generated for. Nodes are used for retrieval search as well as context injection. A node belongs to a document.

<br/>

## User

A user represents the person talking to a bot. Users do not necessarily belong to an org or product, but this relationship is captured in ChatSession below.

<br/>

## ChatSession

Not exposed via API, but this represent a question and answer between the User and a bot. Each of these objects can be flexibly identified by a `session_id` which gets automatically generated. Chat Sessions contain rich metadata that can be used for training and optimization. ChatSessions via the `/chat` endpoint ARE in fact associated with organization (for multi-tenant security purposes)

# **📚 How it works**

<br/>

## Rasa

1. Rasa handles integration with the communication channel, in this case Telegram.
    - It specifically handles submitting the target webhook user feedback should go through. In our case it is our FastAPI server via `/webhooks/{channel}/webhook`
2. Rasa has two components, the core [Rasa app](https://github.com/paulpierre/RasaGPT/tree/main/app/rasa) and an Rasa [actions server](https://github.com/paulpierre/RasaGPT/tree/main/app/rasa/actions) that runs separately
3. Rasa must be configured (done already) via a few yaml files:
    - [config.yml](https://github.com/paulpierre/RasaGPT/blob/main/app/rasa/config.yml) - contains NLU pipeline and policy configuration. What matters is setting the `FallbackClassifier` threshold
    - [credentials.yml](https://github.com/paulpierre/RasaGPT/blob/main/app/rasa/credentials.yml) - contains the path to our webhook and Telegram credentials. This will get updated by the helper service `rasa-credentials` via [update_credentials.py](https://github.com/paulpierre/RasaGPT/blob/main/app/rasa/update_credentials.py)
    - [domain.yml](https://github.com/paulpierre/RasaGPT/blob/main/app/rasa/domain.yml) - This contains the chat entrypoint logic configuration like intent and the action to take against the intent. Here we add the `action_gpt_fallback` action which will trigger our [actions server](https://github.com/paulpierre/RasaGPT/tree/main/app/rasa/actions)
    - [endpoints.yml](https://github.com/paulpierre/RasaGPT/blob/main/app/rasa/endpoints.yml) - This is where we set our custom action endpoint for Rasa to trigger our fallback
    - [nlu.yml](https://github.com/paulpierre/RasaGPT/blob/main/app/rasa/data/nlu.yml) - this is where we set our intent `out_of_scope`
    - [rules.yml](https://github.com/paulpierre/RasaGPT/blob/main/app/rasa/data/rules.yml) - we set a rule for this intent that it should trigger the action `action_gpt_fallback`
    - [actions.py](https://github.com/paulpierre/RasaGPT/blob/main/app/rasa/actions/actions.py) - this is where we define and express our action via the `ActionGPTFallback` class. The method `name` returns the action we defined for our intent above
4. Rasa's NLU models must be trained which can be done via CLI with `rasa train` . This is done automatically for you when you run `make install`
5. Rasa's core must be ran via `rasa run` after training
6. Rasa's action server must be ran separately with `rasa run actions`

<br/>

## Telegram

1. Rasa automatically updates the Telegram Bot API with your callback webhook from [credentials.yml](https://github.com/paulpierre/RasaGPT/blob/main/app/rasa/credentials.yml).
2. By default this is static. Since we are running on our local machine, we leverage [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to generate a publicly accessible URL and reverse tunnel into our docker container
3. `rasa-credentials` service takes care of this process for you. ngrok runs as a service, once it is ready `rasa-credentials` calls the local ngrok API to retrieve the tunnel URL and updates the `credentials.yml` file and restarts Rasa for you
4. The webhook Telegram will send messages to will be our FastAPI server. Why this instead of Rasa? Because we want flexibility to capture metadata which Rasa makes a PITA and centralizing to the API server is ideal
5. The FastAPI server forwards this to the Rasa webhook
6. Rasa will then determine what action to take based on the user intent. Since the intents have been nerfed for this demo, it will go to the fallback action running in `actions.py`
7. The custom action will capture the metadata and forward the response from FastAPI to the user

<br/>

## PGVector

`pgvector` is a plugin for Postgres and automatically installed enabling your to store and calculate vector data types. We have our own implementation because the Langchain PGVector class is not flexible to adapt to our schema and we want flexibility.

1. By default in postgres, any files in the container's path `/docker-entry-initdb.d` get run if the database has not been initialized. In the [postgres Dockerfile](https://github.com/paulpierre/RasaGPT/blob/main/app/db/Dockerfile) we copy `[create_db.sh` which creates](https://github.com/paulpierre/RasaGPT/blob/main/app/db/create_db.sh) the db and user for our database
2. In the `[models` command](https://github.com/paulpierre/RasaGPT/blob/dca9be4cd6fe4c9daaff1564267cdb5327a384a5/Makefile#L64) in the [Makefile](https://github.com/paulpierre/RasaGPT/blob/main/Makefile), we run the [models.py](https://github.com/paulpierre/RasaGPT/blob/main/app/api/models.py) in the API container which creates the tables from the models.
3. The `[enable_vector` method](https://github.com/paulpierre/RasaGPT/blob/dca9be4cd6fe4c9daaff1564267cdb5327a384a5/app/api/models.py#L266) enables the pgvector extension in the database

<br/>

## Langchain

1. The training data gets loaded in the database
2. The data is indexed [if the index doesn't exist](https://github.com/paulpierre/RasaGPT/blob/dca9be4cd6fe4c9daaff1564267cdb5327a384a5/app/api/main.py#L49) and [stored in a file named `index.json`](https://github.com/paulpierre/RasaGPT/blob/main/app/api/index.json)
3. LlamaIndex uses a basic `GPTSimpleVectorIndex` to find the relevant data and [injects it into a prompt](https://github.com/paulpierre/RasaGPT/blob/dca9be4cd6fe4c9daaff1564267cdb5327a384a5/app/api/main.py#L66).
4. Guard rails via prompts are used to keep the conversation focused

<br/>

## Bot flow

1. The user will chat in Telegram and the message will be filtered for [existing intents](https://github.com/paulpierre/RasaGPT/blob/main/app/rasa/data/nlu.yml)
2. If it detects there is no intent match but instead matches the `out_of_scope`, [based on rules.yml](https://github.com/paulpierre/RasaGPT/blob/main/app/rasa/data/rules.yml) it will trigger the `action_gpt_fallback` action
3. The `[ActionGPTFallback` function](https://github.com/paulpierre/RasaGPT/blob/main/app/rasa/actions/actions.py) will then call the [FastAPI API server](https://github.com/paulpierre/RasaGPT/blob/main/app/api/main.py)
4. the API using LlamaIndex will find the relevant indexed content and inject it into a prompt to send to OpenAI for inference
5. The prompt contains conversational guardrails including:
    - Requests data be returned in JSON
    - Create categorical tags based on what the user's question
    - Return a boolean if the conversation should be escalated to a human (if there is no context match)

# 📝 TODO

- [ ]  Implement LlamaIndex optimizations
- [ ]  Implement chat history
- [ ]  Implement [Query Routers Abstractions](https://medium.com/@jerryjliu98/unifying-llm-powered-qa-techniques-with-routing-abstractions-438e2499a0d0) to understand which search strategy to use (one-shot vs few-shot)
- [ ]  Explore other indexing methods like Tree indexes, Keyword indexes
- [ ]  Add chat history for immediate recall and context setting
- [ ]  Add a secondary adversarial agent ([Dual pattern model](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Apr/25/dual-llm-pattern/)) with the following potential functionalities:
    - [ ]  Determine if the question has been answered and if not, re-optimize search strategy
    - [ ]  Ensure prompt injection is not occurring
- [ ]  Increase baseline similarity search by exploring:
    - [ ]  Regularly generate “fake” document embeddings based on historical queries and link to actual documents via [HyDE pattern](https://wfhbrian.com/revolutionizing-search-how-hypothetical-document-embeddings-hyde-can-save-time-and-increase-productivity/)
    - [ ]  Regularly generate “fake” user queries based on documents and link to actual document so user input search and “fake” queries can match better

# 🔍 Troubleshooting

In general, check your docker container logs by simply going to 👉 http://localhost:9999/

<br/>

## ngrok issues

Always check that your webhooks with ngrok and Telegram match. Simply do this by

```bash
curl -sS "https://api.telegram.org/bot<your-bot-secret-token>/getWebhookInfo" | json_pp
```

<br/>

.. should return this:

```bash
{
    "ok": true,
    "result": {
        "url": "https://b280-04-115-40-112.ngrok-free.app/webhooks/telegram/webhook",
        "has_custom_certificate": false,
        "pending_update_count": 0,
        "max_connections": 40,
        "ip_address": "1.2.3.4"
    }
}
```

<br/>

.. which should match the URL in your `credentials.yml` file or visit the ngrok admin UI 👉 [http://localhost:4040/status](http://localhost:4040/status)

![ngrok-admin.png](https://github.com/paulpierre/RasaGPT/blob/main/github/ngrok-admin.png?raw=true)

<br/>

Looks like it is a match. If not, restart by everything by running:

```bash
make restart
```
